The original repository https://github.com/joaomouraosa/Text-Editor-Lanterna
was not provided with a license, and this code is presumably copyright the
authors João Sá and Diogo Fernandes. 

Since the code was posted publicly to github, I assume it is free to use for
purely personal or educational use, but should not be redistributed or
combined with any other files until/unless the original authors post a
license allowing it.

My changes to the original files are contributed back to the original
authors to license (or not) as they see fit.

My contributed files (at present, only the gradle build script, but if I
forget to update this, they will be marked at the top of the file) are
licensed subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public License, v.  2.0.  If a
copy of the MPL was not distributed with this file, You can obtain one at
